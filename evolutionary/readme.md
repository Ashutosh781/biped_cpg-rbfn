# Evolutionary Optimization

This module contains all the evolutionary optimization files for learning the network parameters.

Neuro-evolution is our novel approach to improve the performance of the CPG-RBFN network. The idea is to use evolutionary optimization to learn the network parameters. The evolutionary optimization shows to help with making the controller more robust and genralizable as compared to RL-PIBB.
